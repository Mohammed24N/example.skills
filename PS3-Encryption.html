                <ul>
                    <li style="margin-left: 1%;">Encryption normally works by encoding plaintext into ciphertext This is done through the cryptographic models known as algorithms. Encryption plays a vital role in protecting IT assets. It serves four primary functions:</li>
                    <li style="margin-left: 1%;">Confidentiality: Encodes the data to prevent it from being understood if it happens to be encountered.</li>
                    <li style="margin-left: 1%;">Authentication: This verifies the origin of the data that has been encrypted.</li>
                    <li style="margin-left: 1%;">Integrity: Validates the data that has not been altered since it was encrypted.</li>
                    <li style="margin-left: 1%;">Nonrepudiation: Prevents senders from denying that they sent the encryption.</li>

        <h2>The Challenges of the PS3 Hard Drive Encryption</h2>
        <p>One of the major obstacles that was encountered with the PS3 with the encryption that was placed in the Hard Drive. Various methods were attempted in order to break it including forensic imaging using FTKImager and software-based exploits. these attempts were either limited or unsuccessful due to the heavy encryption that was placed on the Hard Drive by Sony</p>
        <h2>The Security measures on the PS3 Hard Drive</h2>
        <p>Custom firmware exploits were attempted in order to jailbreak the PS3 but it requires special conditions, for example, a downgradable firmware version.</p>
        <p>XTS-AES-128 encryption is in place on the Hard Drive prevents forensic tools from easily extracting the data from it. Please note that there are different encryptions placed in different PS3 models as the Hard Drives in each are different to one another.</p>
