                <ul>
                    <li style="margin-left: 1%;">Encryption normally works by encoding plaintext into ciphertext This is done through the cryptographic models known as algorithms. Encryption plays a vital role in protecting IT assets. It serves four primary functions:</li>
                    <li style="margin-left: 1%;">Confidentiality: Encodes the data to prevent it from being understood if it happens to be encountered.</li>
                    <li style="margin-left: 1%;">Authentication: This verifies the origin of the data that has been encrypted.</li>
                    <li style="margin-left: 1%;">Integrity: Validates the data that has not been altered since it was encrypted.</li>
                    <li style="margin-left: 1%;">Nonrepudiation: Prevents senders from denying that they sent the encryption.</li>
                </ul>
